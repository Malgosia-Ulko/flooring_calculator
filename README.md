# Flooring calculator

## Description
My first web calculator created as homework during my first programming course.
It was inspired by one of the Polish DIY retailer's website.
It allows one to calculate square meters of the floor, plan spare material, and check how many packages of the product must be bought and how much it will cost.
Some fun math inside the JS. It converts cm input into m2 output. Also, the package number is rounded to full packages.
I'm particularly proud of it as this was done in my second month of learning how to code (from scratch!).
